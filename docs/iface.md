There's byterover and amp and they are both bad.

It needs to be goal oriented, and open facing.

A way to aggregate, assign and do various verb operations
I guess I need to decide on the verbs

So the verbs are

    create account
    get public key
    delete conversation
    label conversation
    search conversation

We are focused here on conversation, byterover has a concept called memory.

When pitching I talked about it as the "why" to match the "what".

Byterover seems to want to unmoor these from projects, as does amp actually. 

I think projects as the context and files as the context are key, it should be fluid and two way.

the question is whether it's too hard - doesn't matter, this *is* the launch strategy

So really we need to find our common unit, how to express it, how to have ownership, essentially a db schema whether we're using an RDBMS or not - it's an exercise of necessity.

## login

It'd be nice if people could just use
ed25519:<pubkey> at first ... this is ridiculously insecure because there's no private key requested or used.

The question is what is *truly* zero friction?
    * most familiar - also, least technical
    * least exotic - nothing new
    * fewest decisions - options cause stress
    * least to remember

## purpose

At different points of a company's growth, users serve different purpose. Here it's advertising, use, advocacy.

It should be structured like github probably. You can
commit new thoughts or concepts, get some kind of progress
indicator. Projects can magically appear and be keyed based
on the url.

People can "claim" their profile by adding a link to their page on the github social link profile page or log in with github.

The goal is to collect llm conversation data associated with projects. It should be public by default with an option to be anonymized.
