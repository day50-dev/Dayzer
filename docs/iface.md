There's byterover and amp and they are both bad.

It needs to be goal oriented, and open facing.

A way to aggregate, assign and do various verb operations
I guess I need to decide on the verbs

So the verbs are

    create account
    get public key
    delete conversation
    label conversation
    search conversation

We are focused here on conversation, byterover has a concept called memory.

When pitching I talked about it as the "why" to match the "what".

Byterover seems to want to unmoor these from projects, as does amp actually. 

I think projects as the context and files as the context are key, it should be fluid and two way.

the question is whether it's too hard - doesn't matter, this *is* the launch strategy
