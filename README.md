DejaView is a memory and routing layer for LLM conversations.
It lets you persist, transfer, and resume threads across tools like VS Code, Aider, chat UIs, and agent shells â€” without losing context.

Powered by a pluggable proxy (e.g. LiteLLM), DejaView tags each conversation with a unique ID and tracks the flow across applications. Whether you're coding, chatting, or running agents, you can recall, merge, or branch conversations like source control for thought.

Built for:

* Cross-app memory: Continue a conversation started in one tool from any other
* Thread syncing: Route context through a centralized store with clear APIs
* Git-style ops: Tag, merge, fork, and audit conversational history
