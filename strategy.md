The approach should be agnostic to tooling. Let me make sure this is possible.

The landscape:
    vscode plugins
        rool, cline, amp, kilo

    ides
        windsurf, cursor, refact, augment

    cli systems
        warp, goose, codex, aider, plandex

    dekstop
        claude, openhands

    chatters
        llm (simonw), librechat, openwebui, on site chat (web, phone)

1. it looks like the app based ones are islands that can't be violated
2. for the others it might just be tool calling + completions api, tbd


So I guess the goal is to get one flow - two tools to be agnostic.
